# Story edition — intent and beat table

A single walk through two hundred days, and a glimpse of two thousand. The cat (and later the pig with her) moves through places they already share: a bright meadow, the things he made, a playful night, the jelly they can poke, the sea and the Changchun sky, a game they play together, the flowers he will give her, the mushrooms she loves, and a house they might one day fill.

There are no chapter title cards. Lines are short, spoken in the scene, and fade on their own. Existing tunings stay: the shop door still says 「外面天黑了。」, night keeps its map and back, the pink iris into jelly, the sea and sky handoffs, coop’s 「往前走走」.

## Flower identity (researched)

The name **云南紫精灵** is a market nickname, not a unique Latin species. Public pages that can be opened today do **not** agree on one plant, so this edition renders the variety that Yunnan/斗南 wholesale listings actually sell under that name.

| Name | What public sources say | Exact URLs opened this pass | How we draw it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 云南紫精灵 | The strongest current wholesale match is a **carnation** (康乃馨), English listing “Carnations-purple fariy / purple fairy”, colour **白底紫边** (white base, purple edge), sold from 昆明斗南. 花礼网 also lists “紫精灵康乃馨” as a bouquet material, which treats it as a carnation rather than 洋桔梗. A separate, unverified older claim that florists used 紫精灵 for a purple lisianthus was not matched to an openable URL in this pass (the previously cited 陌上花卉 2014 thread has no recoverable link here), so that reading is **not** used. 紫精灵 also appears as an unrelated hardy 月季 nickname on some garden pages; that is not the 斗南 cut-flower listing. | http://x7hh.com/pro_show.php?id=157 (紫精灵 · Carnations-purple fariy · 颜色：白底紫边 · 斗南金河花卉); http://www.x7hh.com/goodsgm.php?id=157 (Carnations-purple fariy Grade B); http://www.x7hh.com/pricehuac.php?id=7 (斗南康乃馨价目，含紫精灵); https://www.hua.com/product/9012869.html (花礼网花材表含“紫精灵康乃馨4枝”) | Ruffled picotee carnation: cream/white petals with a purple rim and a bulbous green calyx. Not a solid-violet lisianthus, not hydrangea, not campanula. |
| 戴安娜粉玫瑰 | The common **Chinese cut rose “戴安娜”**, a bright pink (亮粉色) high-centred variety widely grown in Yunnan: many petals, outer petals shorter, inner gradually longer, 高心卷边, large upright head. Flower language on that page: 初恋. Distinct from the English garden rose *Rosa* ‘Diana, Princess of Wales’ (creamy-white edged pink). | https://www.hua.com/huayu/14144.html 《常用的鲜切花——戴安娜》, 花礼网, 2016/1/15 | Layered spiral, pointed high centre, recurved outer petals, princess pink — not a triangle or closed bud |

Double purple lisianthus morphology (for contrast only, **not** used as 紫精灵): https://www.miaoyewang.com/baike/show-8674.html (苗业网：重瓣洋桔梗 10–20 瓣，开放后像月季).

No other flower species appear in the woods.

## Order

**Required (t23u, supersedes earlier flower-before-shop and optional-night plans).** This is also what live Pages run as of t36 (11 November 2026, Asia/Shanghai), matching `STAGES` in `src/shared/flow.ts`:

`meadow → shop → night → jelly → sea → sky → coop → flower → mushroom → home`

(`home` is empty-house discovery, then spatial furnish, then the ending film.)

AR remains a side path from the shop and always returns to the shop (`go('shop')`). Night is **on the mainline** (do not skip it via a lit shop exit). Night’s internal map and “turn back” stay inside the night; every night ending goes to jelly. Jelly has a clear 入海 control outside the mushroom egg (the egg is optional). The 200-day film on `/sky/` is optional. Coop’s 「往前走走」 continues into the flower wood along an open path (not a cottage, not `/home/`). Flower → mushroom keeps the canvas/iris handoff. The mushroom grove ends at a warm **home cottage** window, then the empty house, then spatial decorate. 「保存布局」 leaves the room with no pre-film text and plays the complete Notion v2 200-day film (`anniv-200.mp4`, 1920×1080, 67.712 s). That film’s furniture and blocking never read the saved layout. After it ends, the closing card uses the t35 order (2·3·1·4), last line 「我的小臭猫。」. Home “再看一遍” replays only that film; “从头再来” returns to the meadow. Progress still uses `gift.progress` for the discreet continue affordance.

The unused v4 future-home film (`public/media/future-home.*`) stays in the repo and can be switched back by copying `future-home.json` into `ending-film.json`. A v5 realistic cut is only in pre-release `film-v05` and draft PR #3 — not integrated, not on Pages. The old published order (meadow → flower → mushroom → shop → …) is no longer what live Pages run.

## Beat table

| # | Place | When it is said | 中文 | English | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | meadow | After the heart fountain line, near the door | 这些花瓣好像在请我们再往前走走。 | These petals seem to be asking us to keep walking. | Invitation. A few 紫精灵 / 戴安娜 petals blow toward the shop door. |
| 2 | shop | Shortly after arriving | 你做的那些，都还在这儿。 | Everything you made is still here. | Handmade keepsakes. Existing inspect / AR side path unchanged. |
| 3 | ar | After the table appears | 放到桌上看看……看完我们再回去。 | Let’s set them on the table… then we’ll go back. | Side route; back button still `go('shop')`. |
| 4 | shop dark door | When the cat nears the dark rear door (proximity, not a title card) | 外面天黑了。 | It’s dark outside. | Short whisper, kept verbatim. The dark door is the **mainline** night path. |
| 5 | night | Shortly after the path opens | 牵着手走吧，这条夜路我陪你。 | Let’s walk it together. I’ll stay with you on this night path. | Shared challenge, not a jump scare dumped on her alone. |
| 6 | jelly | Shortly after the pink arrival | 到这儿就安心了。要不要玩一会儿？ | It’s safe here. Want to play for a bit? | Relief and play after the night. |
| 7 | sea | Shortly after entering the water | 那些一起看过的海，还记得吗。 | The seas we watched together — do you still remember? | Shared films and places. |
| 8 | sky | Shortly after the sky appears | 长春的天空。两百天，也都在这上面。 | The sky over Changchun. Two hundred days are up there too. | Real sky + the optional 200-day film already on this page. |
| 9 | coop | When the meadow-for-two is ready | 要不要一起再玩一回？ | Want to play a round together? | They play as themselves. |
| 10 | coop win | Existing button | 往前走走 | Keep walking | They walk the same way along an open path into the flower wood. |
| 11 | flower | Shortly after entering | 紫精灵和戴安娜……好像专门开给我们看的。 | The 紫精灵 carnations and the Dianas… as if they opened just for us. | Names the real bouquet, living here. A small pig follows the cat. |
| 12 | flower | Near the arch | 林子深处开始亮起来了。 | Something is beginning to glow deeper in the woods. | Motivates the mushroom chapter; a first cap may glow by the arch. |
| 13 | mushroom | Shortly after entering | 天暗了下来。这些蘑菇，一盏一盏的。 | It’s gotten dark. The mushrooms are lighting the way, one by one. | Her other love; dusk. The pig still follows. |
| 14 | mushroom | Near the arch | 前面有暖光。窗子亮着。 | There’s a warm light ahead. A window is glowing. | Hands off to the empty house. Does not repeat `home.found`. |
| 15 | home · find | When they stop at the house | 这里有一间空房子诶，我们可以布置一下 | There’s an empty house — we could furnish it a little. | Exact user line. |
| 16 | home · save | On 保存布局 — leaves the spatial room; no text before the film (t35). Plays the complete Notion v2 200-day film (`anniv-200.mp4`). The line below is **not** shown here; it appears on the closing card (stanza 1 of t35 order 2·3·1·4). | （播放前不出现文字） | (no pre-film text) | Save → cream paper veil → film. |
| 17 | home · finale | After the film ends (t35 closing card, order 2·3·1·4). The four sentences are: 1 也许有一天，也许会是第 2000 天，我们已经拥有了一个自己的家。 2 我们已经有属于自己的两百天了， 3 我想第两千天可能也并不遥远吧。 4 我的小臭猫。 Shown as [2, 3] / [1] / [4], with 「我的小臭猫。」 last, slightly larger, a hairline above. | 我们已经有属于自己的两百天了，我想第两千天可能也并不遥远吧。 / 也许有一天，也许会是第 2000 天，我们已经拥有了一个自己的家。 / 我的小臭猫。 | We already have two hundred days that belong to us, and I don’t think day two thousand is that far away. / Maybe one day, maybe on day 2000, we will already have a home of our own. / My little stinky cat. | Exact user lines, t35 order. |

Visual connective cues (not extra species): petals of the two bouquet flowers may drift in the meadow toward the shop door. After coop, pig and cat walk the same way into the flower wood. On **both** flower and mushroom paths a small pig **follows the cat continuously** (walking frames, same grounded path and gap, no overlapping or trapping, coherent facing) — not an entrance send-off and not waiting at the exit. The flower wood may gradually dusken with the first glowing mushrooms near its exit. The mushroom grove ends at a warm home-cottage window, not a shop window. Sea and sky are remembered views — they do not turn the couple into a shark.

## Optional paths (no dead ends)

- Night is **not** optional on the mainline. Full night gameplay and the pastel pink-circle ending into jelly stay as they were.
- AR is a side room from the shop and always returns to the shop.
- The 200-day film on `/sky/` is optional; the path continues to coop without watching it.
- The jelly mushroom egg is optional; 入海 on the jelly page is the mainline way into the sea.
- Home decorating is a spatial room (Module A). Save leaves that game and plays a fixed cinematic (Module B) whose furniture and blocking never read the saved layout. As of t36 (11 November 2026) that cinematic is the complete Notion v2 200-day film (`anniv-200.mp4`); the same film remains optional on `/sky/`. The v4 future-home candidate (`public/media/future-home.*`, 95.6 s) is still in the repo but unused — see `docs/FUTURE_FILM.md`. v5 is only a pre-release / draft PR, not integrated. An empty save still continues. 「继续布置」 returns to the saved spatial room; 「再看一遍」 replays only the film. Known leftover: the film’s white background leaves letterbox bands on a portrait phone.

There are no new chapter title cards. The pig loading curtain still appears only if a page takes longer than 700 ms. Outgoing colour and canvas are handed to the next page so hops are not a flat flash. Music fades out and in across page loads — a single uninterrupted AudioContext cannot span this multi-page app.

## Progress, back, re-entry

- `gift.progress` still records the furthest stage for the existing quiet continue pill.
- Night map / turn-back stay inside `/night/`.
- AR always returns to `/shop/`.
- Home “从头再来” → meadow (full story again). “再看一遍” → montage only.
- All `go()` targets use relative URLs from `src/shared/flow.ts`. Nothing should hardcode `smartlotus.github.io/jelly-gift`.
